/**
 * @packageDocumentation Types entrypoint.
 *
 * Central index for internal types. Prefer importing specific symbols from their
 * defining modules (e.g., `@internal-types/agentConfig`) for tree clarity; this
 * file exists primarily to provide a discoverable doc surface and future-proof
 * re-exports if needed.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This project follows a “types-as-docs” approach. Place comprehensive
 * descriptions and examples on exported types/interfaces in their source files
 * (not here). Keep this file light-weight to avoid duplication.

 * @see https://tsdoc.org/

// Intentional: no re-exports to avoid accidental public API expansion.
// Add explicit re-exports only when a stable barrel is desired.
